When circumstances force them to live under one roof, their children’s daily clashes spark endless drama and comedy. Amidst the chaos, Hassan and Nadia—who begin as adversaries—gradually find themselves drawn together. What starts as hostility slowly evolves into an unexpected bond, as both families navigate love, conflicts, and the challenges of building a new life together.",
